# viviancao-data-related-projects


During my Data Analytics Certification Course at Springboard, I successfully completed two capstone projects. The first project focused on analyzing Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease using Excel and Tableau for statistical analysis. I employed regression and correlation analysis in Excel, incorporating dummy variables to investigate the relationship between different factors and the occurrence of heart disease. Utilizing Tableau, I created visualizations to compare various variables with the target variable, ultimately identifying the key factors that have the most significant impact on heart disease and determining the population most susceptible to the condition.

In the second project, I delved into exploring New York Real Estate Pricing using Excel, Python, and Tableau. Using Python, I conducted exploratory data analysis on datasets, which involved identifying the most popular room type and exploring the relationship between different variables and pricing. To communicate the findings effectively, I developed a captivating Tableau story that visually presented the results of the data analysis, emphasizing key insights such as room popularity and the impact of various variables on pricing.

Through these projects, I gained valuable experience in conducting in-depth analysis, employing statistical techniques, utilizing programming languages, and creating visually engaging visualizations.
